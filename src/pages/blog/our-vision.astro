            People don't have control over their digital lives. Your photos are stored on someone
            else's servers. Your messages go through someone else's infrastructure. Your devices
            have backdoors you can't control. Your money is sitting in someone else's database.

            A Cypherpunk's Manifesto

            These words opened <em>A Cypherpunk's Manifesto</em> in 1993, declaring that cryptography 
            would defend our privacy where laws won't. Bitcoin finally gave us what cypherpunks 
            dreamed of for decades: "private money" that can't be controlled or censored. 
            It's now enabling other sovereign solutions like Nostr to flourish. 
            We are continuing down this same path.

              <span class="text-purple mr-4">•</span>
              <p>You can build centralized services on top of decentralized protocols, but you can't do the opposite.</p>

              <span class="text-purple mr-4">•</span>
              <p>Protocols enable interoperability among different applications. While this is a challenging problem at the application level, Nostr is one of the first to truly tackle it.</p>

            Cryptography
          </h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            "Cryptography is a tool for turning a whole swath of problems into key management problems." 
            It serves two essential functions:

            FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)
          </h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Most privacy-focused or self-hostable software (or FOSS alternatives to popular
            proprietary software) is subpar. It's often ugly, hard to use, and feels like it was
            built in the '90s. Why? Because it's typically created by developers in their spare
            time.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The solution isn't complicated: build a proper organization (business) around your
            open-source software. Companies and organizations like Signal, Proton, Automattic
            (WordPress), Red Hat, and Comma AI (OpenPilot) have all done something similar. Good
            software needs real teams and real funding.

            Hardware
          </h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Current computers—and especially phones—are essentially surveillance devices with
            digital crack built-in. Intel and AMD CPUs have backdoors. Every smartphone is a
            tracking beacon. The entire telecom infrastructure is insecure as well. Those home
            assistants and doorbells? They're government tapewires that you voluntarily put in
            your house.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            We need hardware that's actually trustworthy. Not because someone told us to trust it,
            but because we can verify it ourselves. Open hardware specifications, transparent
            supply chains, and user-controlled security features are crucial.

            Software Design Principles
          </h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            This vision of digital sovereignty isn't just about privacy or security—it's about
            fundamentally reshaping the relationship between individuals and their digital
            existence. One of the first products we are building is a file-hosting and
            synchronization service that is end-to-end encrypted, and every aspect of it will be
            free and open-source.
